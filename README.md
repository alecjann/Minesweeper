# Minesweeper
Hey all.

This is a Minesweeper game made with JQuery, HTML and CSS. It's the second game I've created and posted. I learned a lot about styling in CSS and it was my first time using JQuery. The majority of the code is in the files Minesweeper.js and MineStyle.css.

To try the game follow this link or the link in the description. https://alecjann.github.io/Minesweeper/
